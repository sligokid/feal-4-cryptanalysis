Dear Student,

The CA642 repeat continuous assessment is now available on Loop. The assessment is very similar to the previous one, involving
a linear cryptanalysis of the FEAL-4 block cipher, so any work you did towards the previous assessment can hopefully be reused.

Your task is to discover
- as many of the bits as possible of the six 32-bit sub-keys K0-K5 used in this cipher
- these sub-keys are different from those used in the previous assessment.
- The more bits you find, the more marks you will get.

However you will get some marks for even finding a few bits of the sub-keys.

The source code for the cipher (from which the six secret sub-keys have been removed) is provided in the files FEAL.c and FEAL.java.

An executable version of this code which has the secret key built into it was used to generate the 200 random plaintexts/ciphertexts,
which can be found in the file known.txt.

There are two parts to linear cryptanalysis.
1. Construct linear equations relating
    plaintext P,
    ciphertext C,
    key bits K,
    that have a high bias - that is, whose probabilities of holding (over the space of all possible values of their variables) are as close as possible to 0 or 1.
2. Use these linear equations in conjunction with known plaintext-ciphertext pairs to derive key bits.
